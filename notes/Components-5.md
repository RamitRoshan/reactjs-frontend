# Understanding SPA (Single Page Applications)

Q). What is a Single Page Application (SPA) ? <br>

ans: A **Single Page Appplication (SPA)** is a web application that **loads a single HTML page** and dynamically updates content **without refreshing the entire page.** <br>
SPAs use **JavaScript** to handle navigation and **only update necessary parts of the page,** making them **faster and more interactive.**


#### How SPAs Work ? 

1. Initial Load: When a user visits an SPA, the browser loads a single HTML page along with JavaScript, CSS and other assests.
   
2. Client-Side Routing: Navigation within the application is handled by JavaScript (React Router, Vue Router, etc)
